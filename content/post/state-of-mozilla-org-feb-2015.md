summary: Monthly update on what's been happening with www.mozilla.org
---

Hello all! It's already been a month since last we spoke and much has happened! Let's get to it.

Note: It appears that monthly will be a better schedule for these than every 2 weeks, at least for me. I'll try to keep to that. Please call me out if I fail.

## Theme for February: ZOMG BUSY!

February is always a busy month for we developers in the Engagement team, at least since Mozilla broke into the mobile world with Fennec and Firefox OS. This is because the first of March is [Mobile World Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_World_Congress) (MWC) time, and it's always a scramble to get things done in time. I concentrate mostly on the server side of the Web, but my colleagues in [Web Prod][] who deal in HTML, CSS, and JS were more than a little busy. They launched a [new page for MWC](https://www.mozilla.org/mwc/), a new [Firefox OS main page](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/os/), a new consolidated nav for all of that, and updates to various other FxOS related pages to support announcements. It was a herculean effort, the results are amazing, and I'm more than a little proud to work with them all. Special thanks to our new staff-member teammate [Schalk Neethling][] for going way above and beyond to get it all done.

Also, long time friend of mozilla.org [Craig Cook](https://github.com/craigcook) knocked out a refresh of the [Mozilla Leadership page](https://www.mozilla.org/about/leadership/). Nice work Craig!

Not only all of that, but February saw a major overhaul of how bedrock handles static assets (CSS, LESS, JS, Fonts, Images, etc.). It's all part of [the plan](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Websites/Mozilla.org/Static-Media-Improvements). There's more to come.

1. We have finally moved into the modern world (speaking in Django terms) and are using the [staticfiles][] system. We are now free to do things like handle user-uploaded media, use new and cool tools, and not feel bad about ourselves.
2. We've switched from jingo-minify to [django-pipeline][]. Pipeline hooks into Django's static media system and is therefore easier to integrate with other parts of the Django ecosystem as well as more customizable. It is also a much more active project and supports a lot of fun new things (e.g. Babel-JS for sweet sweet ES6 goodness in our ES5 world).
3. Good Olde Apacheâ„¢ used to be how we served our static assets, but we're now doing that from bedrock itself using [Whitenoise][]. Since we have a CDN the traffic for these files on the server is quite low so getting cache headers, CORS, and gzipping right is the most important thing. Whitenoise handles all of this efficiently and automatically. I highly recommend it.

With these new toys came the ability to generate what are called "[Immutable Files](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#cachedstaticfilesstorage)". This means that the system will now copy all static files to new filenames that include the md5 hash of the file contents. This means that the file name (e.g. site.4d72c30b1a11.js) will always necessarily refer to the same contents. The advantage of this is that we can set the cache headers to basically never expire. Any time the file content changes, the generated file name will be different and cached separately.

We're also generating gzipped versions of all files at deploy time. Whitenoise will see that these files exist (e.g. site.4d72c30b1a11.js.gz) and serve up the compressed version when the browser says it can handle it (and nearly all can these days). This is good because this is no longer happening at request time in Apache, thus reducing load, and we can use better and slower compression since it's happening outside of the request process.

Much more happened, but I'm loath to make this much longer. Skim the git log below for the full list.

## Contributors

Even more new contributors! ***HOORAY!***

* [blisman](https://github.com/lismanb) started contributing to bedrock this month and has already fixed 3 bugs!
* The aforementioned [Schalk Neethling][] is new to the team, but not Mozilla nor FLOSS contribution, nor even bedrock as he's maintained the [Plugin Check](https://www.mozilla.org/plugincheck/) page for quite some time. He did a wonderful job on the new Firefox OS page.
* [Kohei Yoshino](https://github.com/kyoshino) continues dominating all the things and even got yet another [Friend of The Tree](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2015-03-02#Friends_of_Mozilla) (Friends of Mozilla) mention.
* [Stephanie Hobson](https://github.com/stephaniehobson) (on loan from MDN) stepped up to help us with some changes in preparation for the new Firefox for iOS (coming soon to an iDevice near you).

Thank you all for your contributions to bedrock and the Open Web **\o/**
