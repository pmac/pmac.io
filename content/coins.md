I wanted to make these mainly because I wanted one. My wife is a commissioned officer in the
[Public Health Service Commissioned Corps][phs] of the United States, and they
have a long tradition of making and using [challenge coins][coins] for esprit de corps and honoring those
who've done great work for the corps or the team. I've been at Mozilla for long enough now that I
really wanted to do something to show my appreciation for so many amazing people with whom I've
had the honor to work, and to just bring a (hopefully) cool new Mozillian thing into the world.

Challenge coins started as a military tradition, serving to identify to others your membership in
a group, and as a prop in a [drinking game][game], but they're now found in science, business, unions,
and clubs of all types. If you received one of the ones I made, then know that myself or someone I
respect appreciates your contributions to Mozilla and has enjoyed working with you.

Thank you for your contributions to the Mozilla project and the open web.
