[Challenge coins][coins] started as a military tradition to recognize a special achievement,
to prove membership in a group, and to improve morale. They‚Äôre now found in science,
business, unions, and clubs of all types. Coins may even be used to ["challenge" one another on a night out!][game]

My wife is a commissioned officer in the
United States [Public Health Service Commissioned Corps][phs], and they
have a long tradition of making and using [challenge coins][coins] for recognizing those
who've made great contributions to the Corps, the mission, a team, or the health of the nation.
I have seen her coins for years, even been the fortunate recipient of a few after her deployments,
and I decided it was finally time for me to have one that represented my organization.

I've been at Mozilla for over a decade now --- I wanted to do something to show my appreciation
to the amazing people with whom I've had the honor to work, and just to bring a (hopefully)
cool new Mozillian thing into the world. I'm hoping others might be inspired to make coins for their part
of the project, but if not I'm happy with just these.

If you received one of the coins then know that myself or someone
else on the Marketing Websites team appreciates your contributions to Mozilla and has enjoyed working with you.

Thank you for making Mozilla the unique and wonderful place it is, and keep on rockin' the free web ü§ò

PS - I want to thank the folks at [Challenge Coins Limited][coinsltd] for their design help and excellent finished project.
And I also have to thank my wife, [Eva], without whom these would never have looked as good nor existed at all ‚ù§Ô∏è
