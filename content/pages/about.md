title: About

This is my personal site. Nothing on here represents anything but my opinions and work. Thanks for stopping by!

## Prelude

As for me, I'm a husband and father primarily. To support those persuits I work for [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org) as a web developer. It's far-and-away the best company for which I've ever worked, or really ever thought about working. It's an entire organization dedicated to the freedom, accessibility, privacy, and security of The Web. I just love that. Everything we do is [open source](https://github.com/mozilla/) (from Firefox to all the websites), but beyond that it's planned and discussed in the open and liberally licensed. I could go on and on, and in some post I'm sure I will. Suffice to say that I like it there, and if you're similarly inclined I can't more highly recommend [applying](https://careers.mozilla.org/).

[The code for this site][code] is licensed MIT, and the content under a Creative Commons share-alike license linked in the footer.

## Colophon

Who knows what the word "[colophon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_%28publishing%29)" even meansâ€½ I guess we do now, but still. Sites seem to have them now, so here's mine.

This site is hosted at [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=d069f8df6df96b5407f86bbc2dde1424435ba75c) (referral link) using Nginx running on Ubuntu Linux. I use [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) to generate it from [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [reStructured Text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) files. [The code for the site][code] is open and available for your perusal and/or help (PRs welcome ;). Pelican itself is powered by [Python](http://python.org); a beautiful and powerful programming language, and the one I use most in my work. I deploy the site using a [git post-recieve hook](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) and the excellent [git-deploy](https://github.com/mislav/git-deploy) tool for setting up such things.

The theme for the site is based on [Sundown for Pelican](https://github.com/keningle/pelican-sundown). I've integrated [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for all the fancy icons that magically match my color scheme.

## Denouement

If you have questions, comments, suggestions, funny gifs, or angry gramatical corrections, please click one of the links that looks like a bird and let me know on The Twitters. If you're not Twitterally inclined, I always appreciate a nice issue or pull-request filing at [the Github repo][code].

Thanks again for reading.
